# BO1 Zombies in MW2

Incremental mod framework for **retail Modern Warfare 2 (2009), single player**.
The first deliverable is an AMD64 D3D9 DLL that renders a keyboard menu in the
game. BO1 Zombies is a future mode, not implemented in this first test.

**Status: startup control test 2 launches successfully in the owner's retail
game. Test 1's crash was traced to truncating the native D3D9 device vtable.**
`0.1.2-menu-test3` preserves that table and restores the F4 menu for the next
local test. The F4 milestone remains pending until the owner verifies it.
See [menu test 3](docs/menu-test3.md) for the cause, correction, and retest.

## Exact supported executable

The supplied `iw4sp(1).exe` is the September 16, 2026 **64-bit** Steam build,
not the historical x86 executable. Use its normal installed name, `iw4sp.exe`.

```
SHA256 fb7e8a987c371dea7b666091b0b9e2011c0cd9cd277b191ad453d11d557dd777
PE     AMD64 / PE32+ / ASLR
```

An executable hash mismatch disables game-state access and memory writes.
The installer rejects a mismatched build. A manually installed proxy can still
show its diagnostic menu in an unknown AMD64 `iw4sp.exe`.

## Current menu test 3

1. Close MW2 and extract the entire `BO1MW2-menu-test3.zip` outside the game folder.
2. Run `Uninstall.cmd` to remove an installed earlier project build, then run
   `Install.cmd` and paste the folder containing the installed `iw4sp.exe`.
   Find it through Steam: MW2 Single Player > Properties > Installed Files > Browse.
3. Launch MW2 Single Player normally through Steam. Load a campaign mission and
   wait until you can move the player.
4. Press **F4**. Use **Up/Down**, **Enter**, and **Backspace/Esc**. F4 closes the menu.
   WASD, mouse look, and firing remain available; opening the menu does not pause.
5. Verify category navigation, live gameplay, and normal controls after closing
   the menu. God Mode testing follows once the menu is stable.
6. Close the game and run `Diagnose.cmd`. Return its ZIP and the observations
   requested in [testing.md](docs/testing.md).

For manual installation, copy only the package's `d3d9.dll` beside `iw4sp.exe`.
Never overwrite an existing `d3d9.dll`; temporarily move a previous wrapper out
of the folder for this isolated test. Keep the original Bink DLL and all fastfiles.
For manual removal, close the game and remove that copied `d3d9.dll`.
`Uninstall.cmd` removes an installer-owned DLL after checking its receipt and hash.

The status HUD should appear near the upper left. Logs are written to
`<MW2>\bo1mw2\logs\latest.log`; the fallback is `%LOCALAPPDATA%\BO1MW2`.
Copy the log immediately after a failing run: `latest.log` is replaced on launch.

## Architecture

The executable imports `Direct3DCreate9` from `d3d9.dll`. An application-directory
proxy loads the real DLL by absolute System32 path and forwards the factory call.
It patches only the existing table's `CreateDevice` slot, then the device table's
`EndScene`, `Present`, `Reset`, and `Release` slots. Native object vptrs and all
unselected public/private slots remain intact. Originals are saved per shared
table; untracked instances forward normally. Per-device records own the menu.
Patches use compare-and-swap and conditional rollback to preserve competing edits.

The first build instead copied only the documented public table entries. The
owner's Windows runtime calls private device slot 134 during `SetRenderState`;
that exceeded the 119-entry copy and caused an execute access violation. Merely
extending a guessed copy is insufficient. Test 3 preserves the complete native
table without assuming its private size. This finding does not change any IW4
or T5 game structure.

EndScene draws only on the backbuffer; Present provides a fallback scene if the
engine ended on an offscreen target. A state block and explicit transform/viewport
restoration protect the engine's rendering state. A local Windows font becomes
a managed texture atlas; no game fonts or third-party UI library are bundled.
The window procedure queues input; menu actions and rendering run on the frame
callback. Only God Mode changes game data, using a single atomic flag-bit toggle.

Engine resolution requires the full executable SHA256, five unique `.text`
patterns, name anchors, in-image pointer slots, typed/named dvars, a running server,
a nonempty map name, a valid slot-zero entity, and positive player health.
The owner test 1 log resolved all five signatures and name anchors in the live
process. Active-level fields and God behavior still require mission observations.
No historical IW4 address is used. No T5 structure is cast as an IW4 structure.
Hooks are process-lifetime objects; DLL hot-unload is intentionally unsupported.
This proxy targets the supplied game's regular D3D9 device, not a general D3D9Ex
or arbitrary-game overlay. `Direct3DCreate9Ex` is forwarded without hooking.

## Build

Windows: Visual Studio C++ desktop tools, Windows SDK, and CMake.

```powershell
cmake -S . -B build -A x64 -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build --config RelWithDebInfo
ctest --test-dir build -C RelWithDebInfo --output-on-failure
```

The DLL is `build\RelWithDebInfo\d3d9.dll`. Copy it to `dist\d3d9.dll` to use the
source checkout's installer. MSVC links the C++ runtime statically.
The separate startup control and probe are described in
[startup-test2.md](docs/startup-test2.md); their delivered build uses MinGW.

Linux cross-build: MinGW-w64 x64, CMake, and make or Ninja.

```sh
cmake -S . -B build-win64 -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/mingw-x64.cmake \
  -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF
cmake --build build-win64 -j
cmake -S . -B build-native -DBUILD_TESTING=ON
cmake --build build-native
ctest --test-dir build-native --output-on-failure
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py'
```

For input metadata and signature verification, install `requirements-dev.txt`:

```sh
python3 tools/inspect_inputs.py /path/to/iw4sp.exe /path/to/BlackOps.exe
python3 tools/verify_profile.py /path/to/iw4sp.exe
python3 tools/extract_bo1_scripts.py /path/to/zombie_theater.ff \
  /path/to/common_zombie_patch.ff /path/to/zombie_theater_patch.ff
```

Extracted sources live under ignored `local-data/bo1/<zone>/<asset path>`. Patch
sources must take precedence over base zones when resolving a final script set.
The extractor validates inline compressed records but is not a full XAsset parser.
Original games remain user-supplied inputs and must never be added to this repo.

Advance only after menu load/navigation, live gameplay, mission changes, and
renderer recovery have been verified locally. Then validate the God flag and
level gates. Only afterward start read-only AI inspection and BO1 compatibility work.
